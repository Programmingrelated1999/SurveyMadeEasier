August 4th - One of the challenges I faced was figuring out how to set up a form liked element inside another form. The outside form is the question form. The inside formlike was more of a question type form where user select a question type and the app conditionally renders the requirements for making that question. For example, when the user clicks next question button on the form, the user will be presented with a dropdown menu consisting of multiple_choices, text, review, etc... Suppose, the user choose multiple choices, then the user will be able to set up the choices. This was a challenge where the inside form would submit the outside form as well.

## Lesson Learn

One of the lesson I learned is that HTML does not allow nested forms.
